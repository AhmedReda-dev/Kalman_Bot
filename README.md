# Kalman_Bot

## to add noise to turtlebot3_burger :
1. go to 
`cd \catkin_ws\src\turtlebot3\turtlebot3_description\urdf `
2. replace the file "turtlebot3_burger.gazebo.xacro" with the modified one in the repo

#### *Note:* I have modified the values of gaussianNoise at line 80  and the stddev at line 88 & 95
